# **COMPASS (Cognitive Management & Productivity Assistant Support System)**

### **What is COMPASS?**

COMPASS is an **AI-powered workplace assistant** designed to **boost productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and improve work efficiency**. The system integrates advanced AI technologies to help users **manage tasks, schedule meetings, analyze workplace behavior, and optimize their workflows**.

### **Why Are We Building It?**

In modern workplaces, employees face **overload from emails, meetings, and scattered information**. Many tasks, such as **managing schedules, taking notes, and retrieving information**, are repetitive and time-consuming. COMPASS aims to **reduce manual effort by acting as a smart digital assistant** that understands user needs and automates daily operations.

## **How Will COMPASS Work?**

COMPASS will be a **multimodal AI assistant** that interacts with users through **voice, text, and vision**. It will include the following features:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Task & Workflow Automation**

- Automatically **organizes and prioritizes** tasks based on deadlines and importance.
- Integrates with **email and calendars** (Google/Microsoft 365) to schedule meetings and send reminders.
- Uses **AI agents** to automate repetitive workflows like responding to emails or summarizing documents.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Meeting Assistant**

- **Records and transcribes meetings** in real-time using speech-to-text technology.
- Extracts key points and **suggests action items** after meetings.
- Integrates with collaboration tools like **Slack** to provide meeting summaries.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Cognitive Insights & Behavior Analysis**

- Uses **computer vision** to detect **user focus, fatigue, and posture** to improve ergonomics.
- Monitors productivity levels and provides recommendations for better time management.
- Can detect stress levels based on facial expressions and suggest breaks when needed.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Knowledge Retrieval**

- Implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to pull relevant documents and summaries in response to user queries.
- Allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive AI-generated answers with supporting documents.

## **How Will We Build It?**

To develop COMPASS, we will use **cutting-edge AI, backend, and frontend technologies** while ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. Here‚Äôs how:

### **üß† Artificial Intelligence (AI/ML) Implementation**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** ‚Üí Helps the AI understand user queries, process emails, and summarize text.
    - Uses **Hugging Face Transformers** (e.g., Mistral-7B or Llama-3) for fast and accurate responses.
    - **LangChain** will connect AI models with relevant databases to retrieve important information.
- **Speech Recognition** ‚Üí Converts spoken words into text using **Whisper** by OpenAI.
- **Computer Vision** ‚Üí Tracks user activity and posture using **MediaPipe and OpenCV**.
- **AI Agents** ‚Üí **AutoGen** (by Microsoft) will allow multiple AI models to work together and automate tasks.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Backend & Infrastructure**

- **FastAPI** will be used to create a fast and scalable API to connect the AI models with the frontend.
- **PostgreSQL** will store user data securely, while **Redis** will be used for quick caching of frequently accessed data.
- **ONNX Runtime** will ensure that AI models run efficiently across different devices, whether on **local machines or cloud servers**.

### **üé® Frontend & User Experience**

- The web application will be built using **React** with **TypeScript** for a smooth, modern UI.
- **Electron** will allow us to create a cross-platform desktop application.
- Future mobile support may be added using **React Native**.

### **üîó Integrations & Automations**

- **Google Workspace & Microsoft 365 APIs** ‚Üí For email automation, calendar scheduling, and document retrieval.
- **Slack API** ‚Üí For team collaboration and AI-powered workplace updates.
- **Zapier** (optional) ‚Üí To connect with external tools that don‚Äôt have direct API support.

- Integrate **voice and text-based AI assistant** into the interface.

### **Step 4: Integration with Third-Party Services**

- Connect to **Google/Microsoft accounts** for email and calendar automation.
- Enable **Slack notifications and reminders**.

### **Step 5: Security & Data Privacy Measures**

- Implement **AES-256 encryption** for protecting sensitive data.
- Use **OAuth 2.0 & WebAuthn** for secure authentication.

### **Step 6: Testing & Performance Optimization**

- Run **unit tests, integration tests, and real-world trials** to ensure accuracy.
- Optimize AI models using **ONNX Runtime** to improve response time and efficiency.

### **Step 7: Deployment & User Feedback**

- Deploy the backend on **AWS/GCP** using **Docker and Kubernetes**.
- Gather user feedback and continuously improve features based on real-world use.
